Some of the filtering i might do client/swift side.
e.g. filtering for tags? may be faster

CHECK NULL INSTEAD OF !param - in case zero

keep API design consistent - some endpoints return/take individual fields, some use a whole JSON object, make these the same

It's currently ok to make a new drink using deleted ingredients - remember that the only point of deleting is to hide it from the user in the UI

Maybe add support for creating sessions offline and uploading later.
